# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
This program asks the user to input the name of a celebrity. The first API gets that person's birthday, the second API then comes up with a historical event from the month they were born, as well as three other historical events. The four events are then shuffled and the user is asked to guess the correct event from that month.
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
No known bugs, although theoretically one of the random events could be in the same month. Chances are very low though.

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
Historical Events API - https://api-ninjas.com/api/historicalevents
Celebrity API - https://api-ninjas.com/api/celebrity

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
For the final project (not exam) I based my naming conventions on examples from the website, but several of these examples are different from the style guide so for this exam I just stuck with the style guide.
